<h2>Projects with known vulnerabilities that have been fixed</h2> 

The following is a list of open source projects which had known security 
vulnerabilities which have now been fixed. In many cases, copies of those 
projects were made before the vulnerability was fixed. In some cases, the 
copy was fixed, but in other cases the vulnerability is still present in 
the copy.
<p>
Each entry in the project list below contains 4 lines:
<ol>
<li>The name of the project and link to the project's page. This is the
project where the vulnerability was fixed.
</li>
<li>A link to the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) list entry.
This gives information about the vulnerability and the fix.
The CVE page also includes a link (near the top of the page) to the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD) which gives more information about the 
vulnerability.
</li>
<li>A link to a description of the fix.
</li>
<li>
A link to a list of active projects which contain the vulnerability.
</li>
<li>A link to the full report. (not needed for this assignment).
<!--The last section in the Full Report is titled "Projects which have contained one of the presumably vulnerable blobs". These are
projects which have a some point contained the vulnerable file.
There are 3 sections under that heading:
<ol>
<li>Vulnerable projects: These are projects that contain a revision of the file prior to the vulnerability being fixed.</li>
<li>Not vulnerable projects: These are projects that contain a known good version of the file.</li>
<li>Unknown projects: These are projects where the vulnerable file has been changed, but we don't know if the change fixed the vulnerability.</li>
</ol>
